"""
Read-only results & standings APIs.

Endpoints (all require authentication):
- GET /results/weeks/{week}/picks
    Return all picks for a locked week, joined with game metadata.
- GET /results/weeks/{week}/leaderboard
    Return leaderboard (total_points + rank) for a locked week.
- GET /results/leaderboard
    Return leaderboard rows for all locked weeks.
- GET /results/ytd
    Return year-to-date aggregates per player across locked weeks.

Notes:
- "Locked" means weeks.lock_at <= now(); we never reveal picks for unlocked weeks.
- v_picks_filled supplies default (home, 0) rows for missing picks.
- v_weekly_leaderboard already ignores games that havenâ€™t started.
